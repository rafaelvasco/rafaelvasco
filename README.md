Hello There!
I'm Rafael Vasco from Brazil; I've been hacking around since 2006;
I'm a Visual Programmer; I only obtain real pleasure as a programmer when I push pixels around and code game engine and game frameworks;

I was deeply inspired and still am by the DEMOSCENE movement thousands of years ago. That's absolute freedom. That is life.
Programming for me started when I once created a Snake game by directly programming a custom programmable board back in school in 2006. That was it for me; I was hooked for life;

Then I learned how to use the tools that were available at the time to make games: SDL and OpenGL;
With that I started coding my game engines; Always reading code on Github to see how people used Platform handling libraries such as SDL, GLFW, SFML etc, and Graphic Apis such as OpenGL;

I studied/used all the cool guys: SDL2, GLFW, SFML, Love2D, MonoGame, Godot, and several other obscure ones. 

Along the years I coded several game engines; Always learning with them; The new engine was always better than the last; And so on; 
I coded some desktop applications too. All game/gamedev related. Mainly with C# and one with Python with PyQt. 

One of those apps, SpriteMator got published in a C# Game Development book. I was so happy and surprised. Good times;

I'm always coding game engines and of course I'm coding one now. In the end they're almost the same code; Just different names and always getting better each time as I get better and better at organizing code and optimizing things;
I only worked with gamedev professionally one time, developing casino games for a local company. That was mildly fun. Coding my own game engines is much much better;

These days I still code my game engines from the ground up, mostly using SDL2 for platform and BGFX for graphics. They're the best there is today to do things at a lower level. I'm getting my feet wet on audio programming now, that I neglected for so long.

Parallel to that I'm a senior software engineer coding Web Apps and Web APIs for clients around the world; Used a lot of Java back in the day; Nowadays I mostly use JS based thingies, React, Express, Node, etc; 
I developed several different kinds of Web things along the years as well. Always with my Game Developer spirit. Trying to make things as cool and flashy and optimized and clean as possible. And if there's no Frontend stuff. I at least like to organize my code as tidy as possible;
As I always tried to do in my game engines;

And that's it. 
Code On!
